What is this?
=============
This is the code for the RECAP Chrome and Firefox extensions, a program that is used to
liberate millions of documents from the PACER system. To install this extension
please visit its homepage at https://free.law/recap/.


Reporting Issues
================
Please report all issues at the centralized RECAP issue repo, [/freelawproject/recap](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap/issues).


Joining as a Developer
======================
If you wish to contribute to our efforts to drain PACER, please get in touch using the [contact form on Free Law Project's website][contact] or simply get to work on an issue that interests you.


Tips
----
1. You can load an "unpacked extension" from [chrome://extensions/][c] if you enable developer options in Chrome. The same [can be accomplished in Firefox][tempff] by going to [about:debugging][abtdbg], clicking "Load Temporary Add-on" and then selecting any file.

1. While it's true that every court has their own customized version of PACER, there is [a PACER training site that does not charge fees][trainwreck]. You can use this if you wish to work on the system without accruing charges. Note that the extension is disabled on the PACER training site to avoid training documents being sent in. To enable the extension you'll need to edit the blacklist. If you are accruing charges while working on this extension, Free Law Project may be able to help. Let us know.

1. While you're testing things across versions of PACER, you can use a handy website ([json][csv-json]/[html][csv-html]) created by [@audiodude][ad] to find suitable versions of PACER.

1. If you want to auto-zip your code on changes, you have two options. First, you can install a utility called `entr` and run:

        command ls *.js | entr zip -FSr recap-chrome.zip * --exclude=*node_modules*
    
    Alternatively, for Firefox, you can use the [web-ext][we] tool, with a command like:
     
        web-ext run --firefox-profile recap-debugging --start-url https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/DktRpt.pl?178502 --start-url https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4214664/national-veterans-legal-services-program-v-united-states/
    
    To run that you'll need a `recap-debugging` profile first, but running that will set up auto-reload of the extension in Firefox. It will also load a couple useful URLs in your debugging window.
    
    

Tests
=====
We got those! You can (and should) run the tests before you push. To do that,
install the dependencies described in `package.json` by running:

   npm install
   
You will need Chrome installed. Then run:

    karma start --single-run

If the tests pass, give a push to your repo and send us a pull request.

When we pull your code using Github, these tests will be automatically run by
the [Travis-CI][tci] continuous integration system. You can make sure that your
pull request is good to go by waiting for the automated tests to complete.

For more information on testing see [TESTING.md][testingmd].

The current status of Travis CI on our master branch is:

Releasing a New Version
=======================
When a new version is needed, the release process is:

1. Update `package.json` and `manifest.json` with a new release version.
1. Run `web-ext lint` to ensure no regressions.
1. Commit the code.
1. Tag the code with something like:

        git tag -s '0.8.4' -m "Releases 0.8.4, fixing replaceState and pushState to work in Chrome 43." -u 'mike@freelawproject.org' -f
        git push --tags -f

1. Zip up the archive with the rather archaic:

        zip -FSr recap.zip * --exclude=*node_modules*

1. Upload that to the [Chrome Market][market].
1. Upload that to addons.mozilla.org
1. Make a new release on [Github announcing the release][ghtags].
